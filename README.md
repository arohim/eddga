This is an internal plugin but openly to use, I make for using very specific Android Clean Architecture [https://github.com/bufferapp/android-clean-architecture-boilerplate] <br>

Currently, Generate Kotlin POJO files from JSON <br>
  - Domain POJO
  - Data POJO
  - Cache POJO
  - Remote POJO
  - Remote/Cache/Data mapper and its unit testing template
  - Remote/Cache/Data mapper from JSON
  - Remote/Cache/Data mapper unit testing from JSON
  - Remote/Cache/Data/Domain Factory from JSON
  - View/Presentation/Domain/Cache/Data/remote template
  - Multi POJOs and Mappers
